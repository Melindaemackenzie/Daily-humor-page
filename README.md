# Daily Jokes

ABOUT
Daily Jokes is a single page application that allows users to browse 10 randomly generated jokes. Users are also able to 'like' a specific joke or add their own joke to the displayed list of jokes. 10 new jokes are displayed everytime the page is reloaded or upon each visit to page.

HOW TO USE APPLICATION
The setup to each of the 10 jokes is displayed upon page load. Users may click each individual setup to display the punchline to the according joke. Once the punchline is displayed, two buttons will appear upon click. One is to "like" the joke, and will say "That is a good one!". When this specific button is clicked, a heart will display below the button, signaling that the user "liked" the joke. The other button that displays is the "add a new joke button" that says "I can do better!". When this button is clicked by user, a form to add a joke will appear at the bottom of the page. Users are able to enter a setup and puncline of their own choice. Once submitted, the user joke will appear below the 10 randomly generated jokes already displayed on the page.
